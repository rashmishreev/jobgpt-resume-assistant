Fine-tune ChatGPT with few-shot learning for personalized resume bullet points. 

I initiated this project in response to the challenges in the job market and the growing importance of tailoring resumes to specific job requirements. Inspired by the increasing use of Large Language Models, especially their fine-tuning for specific purposes, I decided to experiment with few-shot fine-tuning GPT 3.5 turbo to create a system that streamlines the process of customizing resumes for job descriptions.

** Analyzing Successful Examples and Crafting Impactful Bullet Points **
The initial phase involved reviewing successful resumes on platforms like LinkedIn, including those of classmates and alumni, to identify effective formats and content. Subsequently, these selected resumes, along with a guide on crafting impactful resume bullet points, such as the one provided by [Columbia University](https://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/resources/resumes-impact-creating-strong-bullet-points), were used to create a guideline for fine-tuning the model for generating bullet points.
